abstract: "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) aims to find
subspaces spanned by the so-called principal components that best represent the variance in the
dataset. The deflation method is a popular metaalgorithm that sequentially finds individual principal components, starting from the most important
ones and working towards the less important ones.
However, as deflation proceeds, numerical errors
from the imprecise estimation of principal components propagate due to its sequential nature.
This paper mathematically characterizes the error
propagation of the inexact Hotellingâ€™s deflation
method. We consider two scenarios: i) when the
sub-routine for finding the leading eigenvector is
abstract and can represent various algorithms; and
ii) when power iteration is used as the sub-routine.
In the latter case, the additional directional information from power iteration allows us to obtain a
tighter error bound than the sub-routine agnostic
case. For both scenarios, we explicitly characterize how the errors progress and affect subsequent
principal component estimations."
