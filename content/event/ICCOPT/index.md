summary: Join me in a discussion of the analysis of Nesterov's momentum for deep neural network training.
abstract: In this talk, I will discuss the result in my paper "Provable Accelerated Convergence of Nesterov’s Momentum for Deep ReLU Neural Networks", which introduces the notion of "partially strong convexity" that is tailored to the analysis of over-parameterized neural networks. I will also discuss the future directions of extending the framework to the so-called "feature learning" regime.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
