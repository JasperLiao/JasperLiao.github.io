        Consider Algorithm A and Problem B that naturally arises in the broad field of machine learning. I try to answer the following questions:
        - What is the theoretical guarantee of Algorithm A?
        - What are the mathematical properties of Problem B?
        - How to leverage the mathematical properties of Problem B to design a more effective and provable version of Algorithm A?

        My recent focus is on the theory of deep learning.
