#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

My name is <b>Fangshuo Liao (ÂªñËä≥ÁÉÅ)</b>, and my preferred name is <b>Jasper</b>. I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Rice University in Houston, TX, advised by <a href="https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/">Dr. Anastasios Kyrillidis</a>. I also participate in the <a href='https://akyrillidis.github.io/aiowls/'>AI-OWLS</a> research cluster. Before my PhD, I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Rice University in 2020.

My research interest lies broadly in deep learning theory, convex and nonconvex optimization, as well as developing methods that provably improve the efficiency of solving machine learning problems.

Aside from work, I am also interested in cooking, coffee making, board games, and murder mystery games (ÂâßÊú¨ÊùÄ). In the past two years, I also participated in the theatrical productions of Rice Chinese Theater Club, where I was the president, production stage manager, and an actor.

I also have three cats. I love them a lot!
