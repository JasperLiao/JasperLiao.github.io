<p>
My name is Fangshuo Liao (廖芳烁) and my preferred name is Jasper. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rice University in Houston, TX advised by <a href="https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/">Dr. Anastasios Kyrillidis</a>. My research interest lies broadly in deep learning theory, convex and nonconvex optimization, as well as developing methods that provably improve the efficiency of solving machine learning problems. In particular, my past works include the theory of distributed training methods, neural network pruning, as well as gradient-based algorithm when applied to neural networks.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I received Bachelor of Science in Computer science and Bachelor of Arts in Mathematcs degree from Rice University in 2020. As an undergraduate student at Rice University, I worked with <a href="https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/">Dr. Anastasios Kyrillidis</a> on applying deep learning techniques to inverse problems. In summer 2018, I worked at <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/">Baylor College of Medicine</a> as a research intern with <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/robert-waterland-32864">Dr. Robert Waterland</a> on computational epigenetics.
